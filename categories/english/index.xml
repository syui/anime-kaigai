      <description>&lt;p&gt;Translate : &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.animatetimes.com/news/details.php?id=1516333521&#34;&gt;https://www.animatetimes.com/news/details.php?id=1516333521&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From January 2018 TV animation &amp;lsquo;Slow Start&amp;rsquo; broadcasting at TOKYO MX and others, (Original: Atsumi Masako / &amp;lsquo;Manga Time Kirara&amp;rsquo; series serial). In the Animate Times, in conjunction with the official website, a long version of a series project &amp;lsquo;animate Times Presents Slow Start Relay Interview&amp;rsquo; targeting everyone in the main cast and the staff is posted. It is Mr. Masaru Naganawa who is Mr. Sengoku, who will appear in the third one! We have answered questions unique to the crown, including the impression of the character we perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Masaru Sengoku, Mari Naganawa (hereinafter, Naganawa): When I read the original work at the beginning, I thought, &amp;lsquo;How small a child is, really a high school student&amp;rsquo; (laugh). Even when I introduce myself in class, I&amp;rsquo;m pulling in shy and knowing that my hair is fluffy and small animal series. But as I read it, I do not have a few words, but I told you something that everybody did not feel comfortable saying, or something like that, &amp;lsquo;I think, unexpectedly the core is a strong child&amp;rsquo; It became clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naganawa: The crown has few speech lines and scripts are often written as &amp;lsquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;, but even if I talk about it being one-on-one, as soon as three or more people talk, they will not talk soon, so high school When I was having lunch with a group in the group, I was trying to eat it ~ (laugh), that is similar. Just listening to everyone &amp;rsquo;s talking is fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagan: I think crowns are a very selfish child. It&amp;rsquo;s really straightforward for what I want and what I want to do, so when I am playing it, I&amp;rsquo;m cherishing the feeling of &amp;lsquo;doing things that the crown really wants to do&amp;rsquo;. For example, even when it comes to a story like &amp;lsquo;I will deliver better things next year&amp;rsquo; about birthday gifts for Hana Hana in the first episode, the crown that I kept till then suddenly thinks &amp;lsquo;Hall cake is good&amp;rsquo; It is like saying his own greed like something like that (laugh). It&amp;rsquo;s really fun when playing the crown at my own pace (laugh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naganawa: When Mr. Acoustic Director says, &amp;lsquo;This performance is a bit more like this,&amp;rsquo; you actually do a sample and show us. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m lectured to Reinan (Kondo) as &amp;lsquo;Welcome to Muku and feel like English?&amp;rsquo; Like &amp;lsquo;Welcome to Wonderful, Welcome ~&amp;rsquo; but it is fun and everyone is always I am laughing (laugh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naganawa: I did not have much lectures, but I always thought I wanted to be blurred somewhere (laugh). While drinking, I think that it will be slightly different, I am going to put in an awkward ad lib, but mostly it says &amp;lsquo;I do not need&amp;rsquo; (laugh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there was a scene in which a crown wears a tiara in a dress shape and is praised by a person because of the imaginary delusion when talking about the origin of the name in the first episode. I told you &amp;lsquo;Please add ad libs&amp;rsquo; over there and said &amp;lsquo;This foolish people&amp;rsquo;. Then I laughed very much beyond the booth, I became OK and I thought &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m happy!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naganawa: In the sports test of episode 2, it is a place where a crown is &amp;lsquo;caught&amp;rsquo; and a cool shoulder is presented to a tired Hana name. But, after all, the two people slid down the banks, &amp;lsquo;It was kind of coolly presented out!&amp;rsquo; It was very fun together with the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a scene in which the crown is &amp;lsquo;I am sorry, gorilla&amp;rsquo; with a certain number of stories in the last round. From the time I read the scenario, this line was personally pointed and filled with the desire to say &amp;lsquo;I am sorry, gorilla&amp;rsquo; as soon as it is after dubbing (laugh). So please look forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagan: It&amp;rsquo;s a song that you can listen to and feel gentle. There are places on the way &amp;lsquo;No, no, no,&amp;rsquo; but here four people have come to say &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; in turn, so that the friends feel friendly from each other like this I thought. Also, on MV &amp;rsquo;s recording day, four people are playing on mobile and taking pictures, something is in youth (laugh). From that day, the relationship between the four people has deepened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naganawa: My high school was a girls&amp;rsquo; school, but everyone was doing very well. Even in the morning, &amp;lsquo;Hello, good morning ~! Today is going to work hard!&amp;rsquo; It hugs me (laugh). It is normal driving, I was not so energetic so it seems like &amp;lsquo;&amp;hellip; Good luck&amp;rsquo; (laugh). The most surprising thing was that as the people ran through the corridor, the floor came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next I would like to move to the relay question section, but from last time Mr. Lingouchi said that he wanted to keep a cat before Ms. Naganawa said &amp;lsquo;If you can keep a pet, I will keep what animal What is your name? &amp;lsquo;Asked&amp;rsquo; What is your name? &amp;lsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagano: I&amp;rsquo;m lost ~. A cat, a dog or a bird &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; For now, I will make cats and birds one by one. The type of cat is Munchkin, so its name is astringent &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; The name of the pet is thinking when walking well, I have not kept it (laugh). That&amp;rsquo;s why I thought about this, &amp;lsquo;Seirin&amp;rsquo; of a cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagan: What? You do not want twist? When asked, &amp;lsquo;What do you mean cute cat?&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;What do you think?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Wow? Cocoa?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;No,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Mocha?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;No,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;I do not know&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;The correct answer is Ki It was Ming! &amp;ldquo; Well, why did you want it? &amp;lsquo;(Laugh). I want to laugh a lot (laugh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naganuma: I will make the bird frame cockatoo. Is not she really cute? My parents also have botanical birds and I like birds, but I imitate cockatrooms and will sing. But if I can not remember it, after singing &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my musical interval&amp;rsquo; properly, I will become a scene like &amp;lsquo;I made a mistake now &amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;. The touching feeling is very cute, similar to human beings. As for the name, it is nice to have a Japanese style, but I&amp;rsquo;d like a name like this. &amp;lsquo;Hayato&amp;rsquo; (laugh). Because I want a reaction like &amp;lsquo;Why ~?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;I know something in a acquaintance&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naganawa: I think some people viewing up until the second episode feel uneasy how Hana Names will get along with everyone from now on, but after the third episode, Hana also has a more heart Tama is going to be open, Tama is becoming a child full of more gags, Ekiko &amp;rsquo;s gentle tsukkin&amp;rsquo; s response to it, it is a strict correspondence of the crown (laugh), everyone &amp;rsquo;s expression also goes along with deepening our mutual ties I think that I would like to see it while having fun because I will increase more and more. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
